# isobar-test

## Installation ##
 - Download the repo into a folder called `isobar-test`
 - `cd isobar-test`
 - `npm install` to ensure all NPM packages are up to date
 - `yarn run serve` to run the server
 - Open a browser and go to `localhost:8080`

## Notes ##

 - I was unable to get the fake authentication to work, so I have commented the functionality and the modal code out.
 - The modal code is not CSS formatted, given that I was unable to successfully get the fake authentication to work.
